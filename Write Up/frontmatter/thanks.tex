\newthought{I would firstly like to thank}, my advisors, Professors James Robins, Miguel Hernan and David Harrington.  Without the support and previous work of Professors Robins and Hernan, this thesis would not have been possible.  They guided me through this process and taught me many important things.  To Dave, I would like to say thank you for being my advisor and mentor for the last few years.  Without you, I would not be studying statistics or have had many of the wonderful opportunities that have been presented to me.  

I would also like to thank my family and friends.  My mother has worked tirelessly to raise my brother and me, and for that, we are forever grateful.  I would also like to thank her for teaching me about medicine and research my entire life, helping me to understand the framework of my thesis.  To my friends, thanks for being endlessly supportive while I wrote my thesis, for bringing me snacks and coffee, and for forcing me to leave the library on occasion. 

I would finally like to thank all the people who spent time reading and editing bits and pieces of my thesis.  I truly appreciate all the help.
