\section{Natural Course} 
In order to test the models used for the g-formula method, a natural course study was performed.  This involved simulating the data directly from the models being used in the g-formula method.  Additionally, a model for the treatment variable had to be created as well, giving the following three models, 

\begin{align} 
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c} 
Variable & True Mean & Natural Course Average Mean & Natural Course 95\% CI \\ 
\hline 
Y & 0.714 & 0.719 & (0.705, 0.733) \\
A & 0.848 & 0.847 & (0.840, 0.854) \\
L1 & 0.833 & 0.811 & (0.793, 0.830) \\
\end{tabular} 
\end{align} 

\section{Simulation of the Two Methods} 



\section{Confirming Double Robustness} 
Fifty simulations were performed in order to test the double robustness of the ``doubly'' robust estimator.  Four different setups were tested: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Using the correct model for both user specified functions, $\hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}$ and $s_{m-1}$ 
\item Using an intentionally misspecified model for $\hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}$ while keeping the correct model for $s_{m-1}$ 
\item Using an intentionally misspecified model for $s_{m-1}$ while keeping the correct model for $\hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}$
\item Using intentionally misspecified models for both $\hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}$ and $s_{m-1}$ 
\end{itemize} 

The misspecified models used were as follows, 
\begin{align} 
f(A_m \mid \overline{L}_m, \overline{A}_{m-1}; \hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}) &= \alpha'_{0} + \alpha'_{1} \cdot L_{m-3} + \alpha'_{2} \cdot A_{m-3} \\ 
s_{m}(\overline{L}_{m}, \overline{A}_{m};\mathbf{\beta}_{m}) &= \theta'_0 + \theta'_1 A_{m} +\theta'_2 A_{m-4} + \theta'_3 L_{m-4} 
 \end{align} 

\begin{align} 
\begin{tabular} {c | c  c}
Models & Mean & CI \\ 
\hline  
Both models correctly specified & 0.0009 & (-0.009, 0.011)\\ 
$\hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}$ correct, $s_{m-1}$ misspecified & 0.0113 & (-0.001, 0.023)\\ 
$\hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}$ misspecified, $s_{m-1}$ correct & 0.0079 & (-0.067, 0.082) \\
Both models misspecified & 0.0156 & (0.003, 0.028) 
\end{tabular}
\end{align}
